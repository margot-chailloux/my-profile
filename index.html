	<h2>Volley Ball</h2>
	<p id="volley">
		I have been playing volleyball for three years now and I absolutely love the team spirit we have there. Unfortunately Covid has stopped me from playing with my team, now i just play in my garden with my family.

	<h3>Music</h3>
	<p id="music">
		I have always been a very big fan of music. My parents educated me through songs and I also enjoy singing now. My favorite artists are Bruno Major, Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator and Lauv. I absolutely love concerts, and have been to a couple, Shawn Mendes, Lauv, Madonna, The Solidays (Macklemore), and BTS. My favorite moments to listen to music are in long car rides, on my bike at night, and in the train.

	<h4>Travelling</h4>
	<p id="travelling">
		Eversince my first day on this planet, I have been used to planes. At about 2 months old my parents took me all the way to Australia! So far I have been to England, Scotland, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Panama, and I also love going to visit my family in Canada. One day I'd want to go to Japan, and New Zealand.
